# Insights-App
Our code for the app we're developing for INSIGHTS Intervention

## How to run:

1) Clone the repository using `git clone . . .`
2) cd into the cloned directory
3) Make sure Node is installed. Currently used v14.14.0, however this and any newer Node is acceptable. NVM is an easy way to swap between version of Node if preferred, otherwise just manually install it.
4) run `npm i`. This installs all of the node-modules (packages) that are needed to compile and / or run the application.
5) run `npm run web` in order to initiate the web client for development. Changes will be live on save. If this asks to install expo-cli or any other dependencies, just follow it's instructions.
